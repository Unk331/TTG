# TTY_APP - Random Number Generator for Table to Game

Welcome to **TTY_APP**, the **random number generator** designed to bridge the gap between **Tabletop** and **Gaming**. Whether you're rolling dice in a tabletop game or generating random values for a video game, this tool will simulate pulse-like randomness with an easy-to-understand interface. 

**Heartbeat** is the core API that powers TTY_APP, providing the pulse of randomness that you need for your **Table to Game** needs, such as board games, role-playing games, or procedural generation in video games.

## üöÄ Features
- **Random Number Generation**: Generates pulse-like random values, ideal for tabletop game randomness or procedural game mechanics.
- **Debugging Mode**: Option to print the current pulse value for debugging purposes.
- **Multithreading**: Uses multithreading for smooth and consistent pulse generation without blocking the main thread.
- **Flexible Output**: Retrieve or modify random number outputs for any scenario that requires a randomized result.

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Overview
- **`Heartbeat.hpp`**: The header file containing the class definition of the `Heartbeat` API.
- **`Heartbeat.cpp`**: Contains the implementation of the `Heartbeat` class methods, providing the core functionality.
- **`TTY_APP.cpp`**: The main executable file demonstrating the usage of the `Heartbeat` API to simulate randomness.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation and setup guide.

## üì• Installation
